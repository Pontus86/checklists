Not a textbook.  Guides focus, provides facts.  No long differential diagnostic lists.  NO HUSK MIDAS as one point.  Rather:  1-Glucose?  2-Naloxone? Should be possible to use when really stressed.

Not for novices.  Can assume that everyone can perform ABCDE, basic CPR.

Less is more.  Text as concise as possible.  For example remove "Indikation".  "Ringer" instead of "Ringeracetat"

OK to repeat a little information that is present in other places to avoid having to click around too much (at least until hyperlink function available).  If it's a lot of information (e.g. sepsis as cause of medvetanderubbning):  refer.

Don't provide several options (even if equivalent). Provide 1 for the sake of clarity

Avoid ≤ and ≥, use < and >

Tydlighet: använd Blodtryck istället för SBT; använd "mikrog" istället för "ug"
