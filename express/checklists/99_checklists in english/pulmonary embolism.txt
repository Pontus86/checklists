Title/1. Crystalloids?
Text/
• Modest fluid challenges (500 ml) followed by reevaluations are recommended

• Aggressive fluid therapy can impair RV function.


Title/2. Vasopressors?
Text/
• Noradrenalin or Adrenalin may be of value in patients with PE and shock/hypotension

• Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 1 ml diluted with 9 ml saline. Give 1 ml (10 µg) every 2-5 min
 
• See Vasoactive Medications

Title/3. Endotracheal Intubation?
Text/
• Ketamine or etomidate are preferable to induction agents that depress cardiac function or reduce preload if endotracheal intubation is required because of impending respiratory failure

• Low tidal volumes (approximately 6 mL/kg lean body weight) are recommended to keep the end-inspiratory plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O to minimize the reduction of venous return brought on by increased intrathoracic pressure.

Title/4. Unfractionated Heparin
Text/
Indication: unfractionated heparin is the recommended initial anticoagulant in patients with high-risk PE

• Unfractionated heparin 80 U/kg IV bolus (or 5,000 U) followed by an infusion of 18 U/kg/hr if the patient is hemodynamically affected but not in extremis. The infusion can be continued during thrombolysis infusion with rt-PA

Title/5. Diagnostic Confirmation?
Text/
Indication: diagnostic confirmation with CT is recommended for the stabilized patient

Contraindication: patient too unstable to leave the ED and immediate CT angiography may not be available.  Under these circumstances, unequivocal signs of RV pressure overload and dysfunction in a haemodynamically compromised patient justify emergency thrombolysis without further testing

Title/6. Thrombolysis
Text/
Indication: systemic thrombolysis is recommended given the high-risk of PE-related in-hospital or 30-days mortality.

"Absolute" contraindications:
• Hemorrhagic stroke or stroke of unknown origin at any time
• Ischaemic stroke within the preceding 3 months
• Central nervous system damage or neoplasms
• Recent major trauma/surgery/head injury in the preceding 3 weeks
• Gastrointestinal bleeding within the last month

Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA; Actilys®) recommended regimens:
• 100 mg over 2 hours
• Very unstable:  10-20 mg IV push followed by 80-90 mg IV over 2 hours
• Cardiac arrest or impending respiratory arrest: 0.6 mg/kg IV over 10 min, max dose 50 mg, CPR, repeat once after 15 min

Title/7. Embolectomy / ECMO
Text/
• Surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-delivered therapy (clot fragmentation and aspiration combined with local thrombolysis) are therapeutic options for patients for whom thrombolysis is contraindicated or deemed too risky, who fail to respond to thrombolysis

• Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is another possibility as a bridge to surgical embolectomy or spontaneous improvement.  ECMO:  _____________
