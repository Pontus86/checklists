Title/1. Ketamine/Esketamine?
Text/
Indication: severely agitated, non-cooperative patient with life-threatening asthma

IV access: Ketamine 10 mg/ml or Esketamine 5 mg/ml 10 ml IV over 30 sec

No IV access: Ketamine 50 mg/ml or Esketamine 25 mg/ml 3 ml IM in each thigh antero-laterally (total 6 ml)



Title/2. Oxygen?
Text/
Indication: SpO2% < 93%

Oxygen via mask or nebuliser to maintain SpO2% 94-98%


Title/3. Inhaled Beta-2 Agonist
Text/
Indication: first-line therapy

Salbutamol 5 mg Neb (< 5 years 2.5 mg). Repeated doses can be given every 20 min.  Nebulized therapy may be more effective when delivered continuously (i.e. 15 mg by continuous nebulization over one hour) and is recommended in severe cases

 

Title/4. Non-Inhaled Adrenergic Therapy?
Text/
Indication: in cases of severe or near-fatal asthma, the resulting hypoventilation may prevent effective delivery of nebulized beta-2 agonists. Adrenergic therapy can be given by alternative routes.

One of the following options:
• Adrenalin 1 mg/ml 0.5 ml (10 µg/kg) IM in the thigh antero-laterally
• Terbutaline (Bricanyl®) 0.5 mg/ml 0.5 ml (10 µg/kg) SC every 20 min x 3
• Terbutaline (Bricanyl®) 0.5 mg/ml 1 ml + 9 ml NaCl IV over 5 min
• Salbutamol (Ventoline® 2 mg/ml) 0.25 mg (15 µg/kg) IV slowly


Title/5. Ipratropium Bromide
Text/
Indication: the addition of inhaled short-acting anticholinergics to inhaled short-acting beta agonists reduced reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function

Ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg Neb (< 5 years 0.25 mg). Repeated doses can be given every 20 min



Title/6. Non-Invasive Postive Pressure Ventilation?
Text/
Indication: uncertain benefit. Recommended for 5-10 min to avoid endotracheal intubation

IPAP/EPAP 8 cm/3 cm H2O. Continue bronchodilator therapy through NIPPV



Title/7. Magnesium Sulphate?
Text/
Indication: life-threatening asthma exacerbations or exacerbations that remain severe after one hour of intensive bronchodilator therapy

Contraindicated in renal insufficiency

Magnesium Sulphate 2 g (Addex®-Magnesium 1 mmol/ml 8 ml) (40 mg/kg) in 100 ml normal saline IV over 20 min



Title/8. Endotracheal Intubation & ICU admission?
Text/
Indications: RSI and tracheal intubation if:
• persisting or worsening hypoxaemia

• progressive hypercapnia despite intensive therapy; however, an elevation of the PaCO2 alone does not indicate the need for tracheal intubation

• severe agitation, confusion and fighting against the oxygen mask (clinical signs of hypoxaemia), progressive exhaustion, decreasing level of consciousness

• silent chest

RSI meds: Ketamine 2 mg/kg + succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg or rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg



Title/9. Potassium and Fluid Therapy?
Text/
Indication: dehydration, hypovolemia, hypokalemia. Beta-blockers exacerbate hypoK

Ringer's acetate 500 ml IV bolus (10 mg/kg)

NaCl 0.9% 1000 ml with 40 mol KCl IV over 4 hours



Title/10. Corticosteroids?
Text/
Indication: in cases of severe exacerbations, exacerbation despite ongoing glucocorticoid therapy or exacerbation that does not fully resolve after treatment with beta agonists

Prednisone 40-60 mg PO (1 mg/kg) or Hydrocortisone 150-200 mg IV (4 mg/kg) or Betamethasone 8 mg PO or IV.  Effect of corticosteroids takes several hours to develop



Title/11. Admission?
Text/
• Patients who have not experienced substantial improvement after 4-6 hrs of care in the ED
• Patients whose PEF is < 40% of predicted or of personal best
• Patients whose PEF is 40-70% and for whom return to home is considered unsafe
