Title/1. Fluid?
Text/
Indication: of value if the patient is also hypovolemic

• Ringer's acetate 500 ml IV bolus (10 ml/kg)



Title/2. Pericardiocentesis?
Text/
Indications for pericardiocentesis, ideally utrasound-guided:
• "Medical" tamponade where pericardial fluid has gradually developed

• Traumatic cardiac arrest if thoracotomy is not possible

• "Surgical" tamponade as a bridge to thoracotomy. However, in this setting, pericardiocentesis will likely provide only temporary improvement since on-going bleeding will cause a rapid reaccumulation of blood in the pericardium



Title/3. Acute thoracotomy?
Text/
Indication: acute thoracotomy is indicated for "surgical" tamponade, i.e. when cardiac tamponade occurs following trauma, aortic dissection or free-wall rupture
