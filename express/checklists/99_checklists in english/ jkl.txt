Title/1. Upright Positioning
Text/
• Place the patient in the upright position by elevating the head of the bed



Title/2. Supplemental Oxygen?
Text/
• As needed to maintain a SpO2 > 90% or a PaO2 > 8 kPa (60 mm Hg)

• Hyperoxia should be avoided



Title/3. Vasodilators?
Text/
Indications:
• Severe hypertension and urgent need for afterload reduction
• Acute mitral or aortic regurgitation
• As adjunct to diuretics in patients with inadequate response
• Patients with refractory HF and low cardiac output

Contraindications:
• SBP < 110 mm Hg
• Significant mitral or aortic stenosis
• Predominant right heart failure
• Nitroglycerin contraindicated in the setting of recent sildenafil use

Options:
• Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL every 60 sec until BP responds and dyspnea improves
• Nitroglycerin 1 mg/ml 0.5 mg bolus IV q3min
• Nitroglycerin 1 mg/ml 10 ml in 40 ml saline = 200 µg/ml. 1 µg/kg/min, titrate up



Title/4. Diuretics?
Text/
Indication: congestion (total body fluid overload)

Contraindication:
• SBP < 85 mm Hg
• Caution in the setting of aortic stenosis
• Not initially recommended in Sympathetic Crashing Acute Pulmonary Edema

Dose:
• Furosemid 40 mg IV for patients not taking diuretics
• For patients taking oral loop diuretics, at least the whole oral daily dose given IV is recommended (e.g. ≥ 80 mg IV for a patient taking 40 mg PO twice daily)



Title/5. Morphine?
Text/
Indication: anxious, restless or distressed patient

Risk: not routinely recommended, associated with increased mortality in AHF (OR 4.84)

• Morphine 4 mg IV along with antiemetic (e.g. Metoclopramide 10 mg IV)

• Alertness and respiratory effort should be monitored frequently



Title/6. CPAP / NIPPV?
Text/
Indications:
• Respiratory acidosis
• Respiratory distress and hypoxia despite above measures

Contraindications:
• SBP < 85 mm Hg
• Vomiting
• Pneumothorax
• Depressed consciousness

Options:
• CPAP 5 cm H2O, titrate to 15 cm if needed
• NIPPV (10/5 cm H2O) if persisting hypercapnia, fatiguing, history of COPD



Title/7. Endotracheal Intubation & Invasive Ventilation?
Text/
Indications:
• Patients with respiratory failure (hypoxia, hypercapnia) who fail to improve despite CPAP or NIPPV

• Physical exhaustion

• Diminished level of consciousness and inability to protect airway



Title/8. Blood Tests
Text/
• Plasma natriuretic peptide level (BNP, NT-proBNP or MR-proANP)
• Troponin (High sensitivity troponin levels usually elevated)



Title/9. Cause-Specific Therapy?
Text/
• STEMI / NSTEMI?  See STEMI

• Structural problem (e.g. papillary muscle rupture)? Consider urgent thoracic surgery



Title/10. Admission & Monitoring
Text/
• ICU admission if SaO2 < 90% despite supplemental O2, heart rate < 60 or >120 bpm, SBP < 90 mm Hg, evidence of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. diminished urine output, altered mental status)

• Loop diuretics: total IV daily dose 2.5 times the patient's previous total oral dose, administered every 12 hours.  If diuretic response is inadequate, addition of metolazone

• Monitor blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse, daily weights, urinary output, renal function, potassium.  Consider Bladder Catheterization

• Na & fluid restriction (< 2g/day, < 2 L/day)

• LMWH for thromboembolic prophylaxis
