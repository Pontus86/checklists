Title/1. Oxygen Therapy?
Text/
Indication: SpO2 < 90%, hypoxia

Oxygen via nasal canula, Venturia mask or facemask, titrated to a target SpO2 of 88-92%



Title/2. Short-Acting Bronchodilators
Text/
Indication: short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists and short-acting anticholinergic agents are recommended despite absence of randomized controlled trials

Salbutamol (Ventoline®) 5 mg nebulized q4h

Ipratropium (Atrovent®) 0.5 mg nebulized q4h


 
Title/3. Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation?
Text/
Indications for NIPPV:
• Respiratory acidosis (arterial pH ≤ 7.35 and/or PaCO2 ≥ 6.0 kPa [45 mm Hg])
• Severe dyspnea with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory muscle fatigue and/or increased work of breathing (e.g. use of respiratory accessory muscles, paradoxical motion of the abdomen, or retraction of the intercostal spaces)

Absolute contraindications:
• Cardiac and respiratory arrest

Relative contraindications:
• High risk of aspiration because of impaired mental status (except when the impairment is due to hypercapnia)
• Large volume of secretions
• Recurrent vomiting
• Recent upper-airway or upper gastrointestinal surgery

IPAP 10 cm H2O & EPAP 5 cm H2O are standard initial settings

CPAP (continuous positive-airway pressure) does not directly support ventilation, but it may indirectly improve ventilation through alveolar recruitment



Title/4. Endotracheal Intubation?
Text/
Indications:
• Airway:  massive aspiration
• Breathing:  life-threatening hypoxemia, respiratory pauses or arrest
• Circulation:  severe hemodynamic instability without response to fluids and vasoactive drugs, heart rate < 50 bpm with loss of alertness, life-threatening arrhythmias
• Disability:  diminished consciousness, psychomotor agitation inadequately controlled by sedation
• Inability to tolerate NIPPV or NIPPV failure



Title/5. Corticosteroids
Text/
Indication: reduce treatment failure and length of hospital stay in COPD exacerbations

Prednisolone 40 mg PO daily (corresponds to Betamethasone 5 mg) for 5 days



Title/6. Antibiotics?
Text/
Indication: increased sputum purulence + (increased sputum volume or increased dyspnea). Antibiotic choice based on local bacterial resistance patterns

Doxyferm® 200 mg PO or Amimox® 750 mg PO are 1st line medications in Sweden

Sputum cultures are recommended for patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow limitation, and/or exacerbations required mechanical ventilation



Title/7. Admission?
Text/
Indications for ICU admission include:
• Severe dyspnea that responds inadequately to initial emergency therapy
• Persistent or worsening hypoxemia (PaO2 < 5.3 kPa [40 mm Hg]) despite supplemental oxygen and noninvasive ventilation
• Severe or worsening respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.25) despite noninvasive ventilation
• Need for invasive mechanical ventilation
• Hemodynamic instability-need for vasopressors
• Changes in mental status (confusion, lethargy, coma)
