Title/1. Ringer Bolus
Text/
• Warm Ringer's Acetate 500 ml (10 ml/kg) bolus

• Large bore PVC x 2

• Intraosseous needle as rapid alternative to PVC



Title/2. Adrenalin?
Text/
Indication: SBP < 70 mm Hg, no radial pulse

• Adrenalin 1 mg/ml 0.5 ml (10 ug/kg) IM; can repeat

If no response:

• Fetch Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml
• Fetch 10 ml syringe
• Dra up 1 ml of drenalin 0.1 mg/ml (100 ug)
• Dilute with 9 ml NaCl (10 ug/ml solution)
• Give 2 ml (20 ug) IV slowly



Title/3. 12-Lead EKG
Text/
• Ischemic ST-T changes may suggest cardiogenic shock secondary to acute coronary syndrome

• Tachyarrhythmia may be the cause or the consequence of shock

• Bradyarrhythmia may be the cause of shock, a manifestation of a poisoning, or indicative of pre-arrest



Title/4. Bedside Blood and Urine Tests
Text/
• Anemia may suggest hemorrhagic shock, but a normal Hb may be present in acute hemorrhage

• Hyperkalemia and hyponatremia may suggest Addison crisis

• Elevated lactate, decreased base excess and bicarbonate are indicative of shock

• Capillary CRP has uncertain value in distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious causes of shock.

• Urine beta-hCG:  ruptured ectopic pregnancy?



Title/5. Ultrasound Heart
Text/
• Tamponade is suggested by pericardial fluid with RA collapse during early systole and RV collapse during early diastole.  Tamponade may be secondary to structural problems such as aortic dissection, free wall rupture.

• Right ventricular enlargement, flattened septum (D-sign on PSA) suggest pulmonary hypertension, e.g. from a pulmonary embolism or chronic lung disease

• Valvulopathy of sudden onset may result in cardiogenic shock



Title/6. Ultrasound IVC
Text/
• Flat IVC suggests hypovolemic or distributive shock

• Full IVC suggests obstructive or cardiogenic shock



Title/7. Ultrasound Perihepatic + Perisplenic
Text/
• Pleural fluid may suggest hemothorax

• Intraperitoneal fluid may suggest hemorrhage, e.g. secondary to rupture ectopic pregnancy

• Hydronephrosis in the setting of sepsis may suggest obstructive pyelonephritis



Title/8. Ultrasound Abdominal Aorta
Text/
• AAA + shock suggests ruptured AAA



Title/9. Ultrasound Lung
Text/
• Absent lung sliding suggests pneumothorax but may occur in other conditions.  Lung-point is diagnostic but will be absent if the whole lung is collapsed

• B-lines bilaterally are suggestive of pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock



Title/10. Additional Tests
Text/
• WBC, thrombocytes, aPTT & INR are routinely measured in patients with shock

• Troponin if cardiac ischemia is a possibility

• Bladder catheterization to accurately follow urinary output



Title/11. Prevent Hypothermia
Text/
• The "lethal triad" consists of the self-perpetuation combination of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy.  Hypothermia should be prevented through the administration of warm fluids, removal of wet clothes etc.



Title/12. Further Management
Text/
• Further management depends on the suspected cause or causes of shock.

• Initial vasopressor:  Noradrenalin 1 mg/ml 2 ml in 48 ml saline = 40 µg/ml

• Initial infusion 0.1 µg/kg/min.  Bolus 5-10 µg
