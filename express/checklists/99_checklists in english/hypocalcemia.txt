Title/1. Information to get
Text/
• Ionized calcium
• PTH
• 25-OH-Vitamin D
• Magnesium
• Phosphate
• EKG: heart block, prolonged QTc, T wave inversions?

Title/2. Symptomatic Hypocalcemia
Text/
Indication: intravenous calcium is indicated in the setting of hypocalcemia, but contraindicated in the presence of hyperphosphatemia because of the risk of precipitation. 

Intravenous magnesium is indicated in the setting of hypomagnesemia.
• Calcium Gluconate 10% 30 ml IV
• Magnesium Sulphate 1-2 g = 4-8 mmol IV (Addex®-Magnesium 1 mmol/ml 4-8 ml)

Title/3. Asymptomatic Hypocalcemia
Text/
• Oral calcium
• Consider vitamin D supplementation
• Consider changing from loop diuretics to thiazide diuretics

Title/4. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF HYPOCALCEMIA
Text/
Pathophysiology	Examples
Decreased oral intake, intestinal absorption, bone resorption	Hypo-parathyroidism	•	Surgical
•	Autoimmune
•	Hypomagnesemia (PTH resistance / suppressed secretion)
•	Hypermagnesemia (when acute & severe: suppressed PTH secretion)
	Vitamin D deficiency	•	Decreased intake/absorption of foods containing vitamin D
•	Decreased exposure to ultraviolet light
•	Decreased 25-hydroxylation in the liver
•	Decreased 1-hydroxylation in the kidney
•	Increased metabolism of Vitamin D to inactive metabolites
Shift-binding	Hyper-phosphatemia	Hyperphosphatemia leads to increased calcium deposition in bone (mostly) and in extraskeletal tissues. Causes:
•	Increased phosphorus intake
•	Tissue breakdown (rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis SD)
•	Decreased renal excretion (e.g. acute renal failure)
	Citrate	•	Transfusion of blood products
	Bone mineralization	•	Osteoblastic bone metastases (breast, prostate cancer)
•	Hungry bone syndrome
	Fat	•	Pancreatitis
	Respiratory alkalosis	•	Both acute and chronic respiratory alkalosis decrease ionized Ca
Increased renal loss	Hypoparathyroidism leads to increased calcium renal excretion
