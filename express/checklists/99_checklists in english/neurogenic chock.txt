Title/1. Target Mean Arterial Pressure
Text/
• MAP should be kept > 90 mm Hg to ensure optimal spinal cord perfusion



Title/2. Crystalloids?
Text/
Indication: initial shock management

Risk: overzealous fluid resuscitation may lead to pulmonary edema, impaired ventilation and cord edema which may impair tissue perfusion

• Crystalloid bolus



Title/3. Atropine?
Text/
Indication: bradycardia

• Atropine 0.5 mg IV should be given prior to procedures that stimulate the vagus (e.g. oropharyngeal suctioning, endotracheal intubation) since these procedures may lead to profound bradycardia.



Title/4. Prevention of hypothermia?
Text/
Indication: patients with neurogenic shock may easily become hypothermic.



Title/5. Vasopressors?
Text/
Indication: a vasopressor should be added if necessary to maintain MAP ≥ 85 - 90 mm Hg.

• Noradrenalin, Adrenalin:  agents with both alpha- and beta-agonist properties such as norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine are preferred given their chronotropic activity.



Title/6. Bladder Catheterization
Text/
Indication: the bladder should be catheterized due to the risk of urinary retention and to follow urinary output



Title/7. Pacemaker?
Text/
Indication: bradycardia refractory to atropine



Title/8. Admission
Text/
• Patients with severe neurogenic shock should be admitted to the neuroICU for monitoring of CVP.  Contact the neurosurgeon.



Title/9. MR
Text/
• MR is the modality of choice to investigate suspected spinal cord pathology.



Title/Therapies of Unproven Benefit
Text/
• Corticosteroids for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury are not recommended
