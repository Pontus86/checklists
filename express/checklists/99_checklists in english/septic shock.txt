Title/1. Oxygen?
Text/
In the absence of underlying lung disease and risk of CO2 retention:
• SpO2 ≤ 90%:  Oxygen 10 L/min via mask with reservoir
• SpO2 91-95%:  Oxygen 3 L/min via nasal prongs.



Title/2. Crystalloid Infusion
Text/
• Crystalloid 500-1000 ml within 30 min for patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion with suspicion of hypovolemia

• Ultrasound to measure IVC diameter during inspiration and expiration may provide a measure of fluid responsiveness, whereby fluid should be administrated as long as the IVC collapses upon inspiration



Title/3. Push Dose Pressor?
Text/
Indication: SBP < 60 mm Hg (i.e. bridge to effect of fluid therapy or acute vasopressor therapy)

Two alternatives:
• Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 1 ml in a 10 ml syringe. Dilute with 9 ml NaCl.  Administer 2 ml (20 µg) IV push.  Repeat after 3 min as needed. Alpha and beta (inotrope, chronotrope) effects

• Phenylephrine 10 mg/ml 1 ml, inject into 100 ml saline (yields a 0.1 mg/ml solution).  Give 1 ml (100 µg) IV every 3 min. Alpha effect (vasopressor), no beta effect.  



Title/4. Vasopressor?
Text/
Indication: when fluids are insufficient to maintain MAP > 65 mm Hg.  Consider if initial SBP < 70 mm Hg, reassess need for vasopressor therapy after fluid administration

• Noradrenalin 1 mg/ml 4 ml added to 1 L normal saline or 5% glucose (4 µg/ml solution).  Start dose of 0.05 µg/kg/min for a 70 kg patient corresponds to an infusion rate of 50 ml/hr.



Title/5. Cultures
Text/
• Blood cultures x 2 sites (aerobic and anaerobic) prior to antibiotic administration if such cultures do not cause significant delay (> 45 min) in the start of antimicrobial therapy

• Urine culture + urine dipstick

• Specific cultures e.g. through vascular access devices, nasal-pharyngeal swab, wound cultures (rapid antigen Group A Strep)



Title/6. Bladder Catheterization?
Text/
Indication: low blood pressure or elevated lactate; in order to follow urinary output and acquire urine for culture



Title/7. Blood Tests?
Text/
• Thrombocytes

• INR: elevated levels suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

• Liver tests: abnormal levels suggest cholangitis/cholecystitis/pancreatitis

• CK: elevated levels suggest rhabdomyolysis



Title/8. Antibiotics
Text/
• Time to appropriate antiobiotic therapy most important prognostic factor in severe sepsis
• Choice of antibiotic should take into consideration presumed infection source, infection severity, local resistance patterns, host factors such as allergies, immunosuppression.
• Local on-line antibiotic guide: ________________________________________________



Title/9. Corticosteroids?
Text/
Indication: patients with known adrenal insufficiency or taking chronic steroid treatment; otherwise, corticosteroids are not routinely recommended in sepsis

• Hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef®) 100 mg IV and then a doubling of the daily dose if the temperature is > 38C or a trippling of the daily dose if the temperature is > 39C.



Title/10. Source Control
Text/
• A specific anatomic site of infection requiring consideration for emergent source control (e.g. necrotizing soft tissue infection, intra-abdominal abscess, GI perforation, cholangitis, intestinal infarction, removal of a potentially infected device, empyema, septic arthritis) should be identified, and the required intervention (e.g. abscess drainage, surgical debridement) untertaken for source control within the first 12 hrs

• Detection modalities include a careful physical examination (including inspecting the perineum); ultrasound to detect e.g. abscess, hydronephrosis, pleural fluid, cholecystitis; bedside chest-x-ray; LP if meningoencephalitis is suspected; CT thorax/abdomen



Title/11. Blood Transfusion
Text/
Indication: Hb < 70 g/L



Title/12. Criteria for ICU Admission
Text/
• SpO2 < 90 % despite O2 15L/min via mask with reservoir

• Respiratory rate > 30/min despite 15 L/min O2 via mask with reservoir

• SBP < 90 mm Hg despite 1000 ml crystalloid over 30 minutes

• Elevated or rising serum lactate

• Diuresis < 0.5 ml/kg/h after 6 hours
