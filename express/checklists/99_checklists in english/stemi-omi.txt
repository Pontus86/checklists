Title/1. Aortic Dissection?
Text/
Aortic dissection can occlude a coronary artery (most often the right). Consider acute CT in patients with sudden onset of sharp retrosternal chest pain. Withhold antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. Bedside ultrasound may reveal pericardial fluid +/- dilated aortic root.



Title/2. Type 2 myocardial ischemia?
Text/
Treat the cause of the type 2 infarction / ischemia, e.g. volume, cardioversion, antibiotics.



Title/3. RV STEMI?
Text/
• Opioids, nitrates, and beta blockers: use with caution due to their potential impact on preload (opioids and nitrates), heart rate and contractility (beta blockers)

• An increase in vagal tone caused by insertion of a bladder catheter can acutely decrease preload and lead to cardiogenic shock.



Title/4. Oxygen?
Text/
• Oxygen by mask or nasal prongs to patients who are hypoxic (SpO2 < 95%), breathless or have acute heart failure.



Title/5. Morphine?
Text/
Indication: to decrease pain and the sympathetic activation that causes vasoconstriction and increases the workload of the heart.

Relative contraindication: SBP < 110 mm Hg, right ventricular infarction

• Morphine 4 mg IV 
• Consider concurrent antiemetics.



Title/6. Nitroglycerin?
Text/
Indication:
• SL nitrates can be used to control anginal symptoms
• Routine use not recommended



Title/7. Acetylsalicylic acid?
Text/
Indication:

Contraindications:
• Allergy
• Suspected aortic dissection

• Acetylsalicylic acid 150 - 300 mg orally (including chewing) or 80 - 150 mg IV prior PCI
• Acetylsalicylic acid 150 - 500 mg orally or 250 mg IV prior to fibrinolysis




Title/8. Heparin?
Text/
• Unfractionated heparin 50-70 E/kg IV bolus, max 5000 E.



Title/9. Statin?
Text/
• Atorvastatin (Lipitor®) 80 mg PO



Title/10. P2Y12 receptor inhibitors?
Text/
• Prior to PCI: Prasugrel (Efient®) 60 mg PO or Ticagrelor (Brilique®) 180 mg PO; Clopidogrel (Plavix®) 600 mg PO if neither is available.
• Prasugrel is contraindicated in prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, ≥ 75 years, < 60 kg, liver disease
• Ticagrelor is contraindicated in prior hemorrhagic stroke, liver disease
• Prior to fibrinolysis: Clopidogrel 300 mg PO if ≤ 75 years



Title/11. Beta-blockers?
Text/
• Early i.v. use of beta-blockers is contraindicated in patients with clinical signs of hypotension or congestive heart failure. Early use may be associated with a modest benefit in low-risk, haemodynamically stable patients.



Title/12. Reperfusion therapy?
Text/
Indications for reperfusion therapy (PCI or fibrinolysis):
• Symptoms < 12 hours and persistent ST-segment elevation
• Evidence of ongoing ischemia, even if symptoms may have started >12 hours before hand, or if pain and ECG changes have been stuttering
• Resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients whose initial ECG shows STEMI.
