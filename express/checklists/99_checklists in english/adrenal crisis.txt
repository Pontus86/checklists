Title/1. Ringer's Acetate
Text/
• Ringer's acetate 1000 ml bolus IV; physiologic normal saline 1 L/h

• Large volumes may be required.


 
Title/2. Glucose
Text/
Indication: hypoglycemia

• Glucose 300 mg/ml 30 ml then glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) 1000 ml infusion



Title/3. Blood Tests
Text/
• Plasma cortisol and ACTH:  The diagnosis of chronic adrenal insufficiency is based on morning cortisol levels.  In a state of stress, however, cortisol levels should be elevated (> 20 ug/dL).  In the acute setting, critically ill patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency, blood should be sent for cortisol and ACTH measurement followed by immediate hydrocortisone therapy

• Plasma renin and aldosterone may also be measured.  Renin and aldosterone concentrations will be elevated if the adrenal glands are unable to produce mineralocorticoids

• TSH and T4 may also be measured, due to the possibility of concomittant autoimmune thyroid disease or multiple endocrine abnormalities



Title/4. Corticosteroids
Text/
• Hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef®) 100 mg IV (2 mg/kg) is the steroid used most commonly.  In addition to glucocorticoid effects, high dose hydrocortisone has a mineralocorticoid effect that precludes the concomitant administration of a mineralocorticoid

• Dexamethasone 6 mg IV does not interfere with serum cortisol assays which may be advantageous for patients without a previous diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.  It has no mineralocorticoid effect but adequate sodium replacement can be achieved by intravenous saline alone

• Hydrocortisone (or other steroids with glucocorticoid activity) should be continued until confirmatory results are available.  Options include:
o Hydrocortisone 50 – 100 mg every 6 h
o Hydrocortisone 100-200 mg infusion over 24 hours



Title/5. Antibiotics?
Text/
• When an infection is the suspected trigger of acute adrenal crisis, patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and "source control" (see Sepsis)



Title/6. Vasopressors?
Text/
• Vasopressor therapy is indicated in the setting of persisting hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.  However, cortisol deficiency may account for relative unresponsiveness to catecholamines.



Title/7. ICU
Text/
• ICU admission is indicated for patients who requires invasive monitoring and/or vasopressor support



Title/8. Short ACTH stimulation test
Text/
• A short ACTH stimulation test can be carried out to determine the cause of the adrenal insufficiency in patients without a previous diagnosis
