Title/1. Crystalloids?
Text/
Indication: hypotension

• Crystalloid 500 ml IV boluses (10 ml/kg).



Title/2. NaHCO3?
Text/
Indication: QRS > 100 msec or hypotension or ventricular arrhythmias. Sodium bicarbonate works by increasing the transmembrane Na gradient and alkalinising the blood.

• Sodium bicarbonate (50 mg/ml) 200 ml (120 mEq) IV push (3 ml/kg = 2 mEq/kg for a child). Can repeat after 5 min. An infusion of NaHCO3 is recommended afterwards.



Title/3. Magnesium?
Text/
•	Indication: ventricular arrhythmia despite two treatments with NaHCO3
•	Magnesium 2.5 g (Addex-Magnesium 1 mmol/ml 10 ml) IV over 2 min.



Title/4. Vasopressors?
Text/
Indication: hypotension despite sodium bicarbonate and crystalloid therapy. To counter the alpha adrenergic antagonist effect of TCAs.

• Adrenalin 0.1 mg/ml 1 ml mixed with 9 ml NaCl. Administer 2 ml (20 µg) IV bolus. Repeat after 3 min if necessary. Noradrenalin infusion (see Emergency Medications).



Title/5. Hyperventilation?
Text/
Indication: if NaHCO3 therapy alone is insufficent to reach the target pH of 7.50-7.55. Acidosis increases free drug binding to the sodium channel.

• Hyperventilate to a target pH of 7.50 - 7.55.



Title/6. Hypertonic Saline?
Text/
Indication: hypotension refractory to NaHCO3, fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Hypertonic saline works by increasing the transmembrane sodium gradient.

• Hypertonic saline 3% 100 ml IV bolus. Add NaCl Concentrate (Addex®-Natriumklorid) 4 mmol/L 10 ml to 100 ml of 0.9% NaCl, yielding a 110 ml solution containing 55 mmol NaCl (2.9%). Can administer twice with 10 min interval.



Title/7. Seizures?
Text/
Indication: seizure in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity

• Benzodiazepines followed by Propofol.
• Phenytoin contraindicated according to some sources since it may worsen cardiac toxicity.



Title/8. Rescue Therapies?
Text/
• Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV if ventricular arrhythmias despite above therapy
• Lipid emulsion (Intralipid® 20%) 100 ml (1.5 ml/kg) IV over 1 min. Can repeat twice
• Cardiac pacing
• Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation



Title/9. Further Management
Text/
• Concomittant potassium channel blockade? Many of the substances that block Na channels also K potassium channels. See Potassium Channel Blockade Toxidrome.

• Admission: patients should be admitted with continuous QRS monitoring.
