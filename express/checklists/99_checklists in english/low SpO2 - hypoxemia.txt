Title/1. Supplemental Oxygen
Text/
Indication: all patients initially, titrate as needed

Non-Rebreather Mask (up to 15 L/min) +/- nasal cannula (15 L/min)



Title/2. Ketamine?
Text/
Indication: combative / agitated / delirious patient

Ketamine 1 mg/kg IV over 1 min or 4 mg/kg IM




Title/3. Upper Airway Obstruction?
Text/
Suggestive findings:
• Stridor
• Snoring
• Swollen tongue, neck
• Low EtCO2

See Upper Airway Obstruction

If intubated:
• Is the tube displaced (e.g. in the esophagus)?
• Is the tube occluded (can a suction catheter be inserted through the tube?)
• EtCO2?

When in doubt, extubate



Title/4. Hypoventilation?
Text/
Suggestive findings:
• Low respiratory rate
• Decreased tidal excursions
• High EtCO2, high blood gas pCO2

Consider
• Bag-valve-mask ventilation (2-person-technique to start off with)
• Naloxone (0,08 mg IV)
• NIPPV (EPAP 3 cm H2O; IPAP 8 cm H2O) after ruling out pneumothorax
• Breath stacking if the patient is intubated and has asthma-disconnect from respirator



Title/5. Pneumothorax / Pleural Fluid?
Text/
Suggestive findings pneumothorax:
• Absent lung-sliding (not diagnostic)
• Lung-point (diagnostic)

Suggestive findings pleura fluid:
• Fluid visible on ultrasound
• Positive V-sign

Consider 12 F catheter in the anterior axillary line 4th intercostal space



Title/6. Pulmonary Edema?
Text/
Suggestive findings:
• Bilateral B-lines
• Decreased contractility
• IVC > 2 cm, IVC-CI < 50% 

See Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema



Title/7. Pulmonary Embolism?
Text/
Suggestive findings:
• Hypotension
• EKG showing RV-strain (e.g. negative T waves in V1-V4 + III; RBBB)
• Ultrasound showing increased right ventricular size
• IVC > 2 cm

See Pulmonary Embolism (High Risk)



Title/8. COPD / Asthma Exacerbation?
Text/
Suggestive findings:
• Decreased inspiration/expiration ratio
• Expiratory wheezes on lung-auscultation
• Absence of EKG/ultrasound findings suggestive of alternative diagnosis
• Elevated EtCO2 in patients with COPD

See Asthma Exacerbation or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation



Title/9. Pneumonia?
Text/
Suggestive findings:
• Asymmetric findings on lung-auscultation/ultrasound exam
• Fever

See Pneumonia



Title/10. SpO2 Falsely Low?
Text/
Suggestive findings:
• Poor pulse-oximetry curve
• Nail-polish
• Methemoglobinemia



Title/11. NIPPV Settings Titration
Text/
Low PaO2/SpO2: increase EPAP and increased FiO2

High PaCO2: increase P-support (difference between IPAP and EPAP)
