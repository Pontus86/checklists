Title/1. Cervical-Spine Stabilisation?
Text/
Indication: potential cervical spine injury in the setting of trauma.

• Stabilization of the cervical spine, manually initially.



Title/2. Oxygen?
Text/
Indication: SpO2 < 95%.  As PO2 decreases, cerebral vessels dilate to maintain oxygen delivery and vasogenic edema may ensue, thereby increasing ICP.

• Oxygen 10 L/min via mask with reservoir to maintain SpO2 > 95%.  



Title/3. Ventilation?
Text/
Indication: hypoventilation should be avoided in all patients with increased intracranial pressure.  Hyperventilation is indicated for patients showing clear signs of increase ICP (e.g. fixed dilated pupil) as a bridge to more durable therapy and not as a routine measure in all head-injured patients.

• Ventilate with mask or via endotracheal tube.

• Capnometry or transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement.

• Target EtCO2 5 kPa (37.5 mm Hg) as default.

• Target EtCO2 3.5 kPa (26 mm Hg) if fixed dilated pupil.



Title/4. Normal Saline?
Text/
Indication: SBP < 110 mm Hg.  A MAP > 80 mm Hg, corresponding to a SBP > 100 mm Hg, should be maintained to avoid decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF), leading in turn to vasodilation, increased ICP and further decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (penumbra areas are very susceptible to even temporary falls in SBP).

• Normal Saline 500 ml IV bolus.  Hypotonic solutions should be avoided since they may exacerbate cerebral edema.



Title/5. Vasopressors?
Text/
Indication:  if normal saline is insufficient to maintain SBP > 110 mm Hg

• Vasopressors are safe in most patients with increased ICP.



Title/6. Facilitate Venous Return
Text/
• Elevating the head of the bed by 30° promotes cerebral venous outflow and is thought to decrease ICP without decreasing CPP or CBF

• Reverse Trendelenburg position is an alternative to elevating the head of the bed

• Head neutral position, excessive flexion/rotation of the cervical spine should be corrected

• Cervical collars should be removed to avoid venous congestion



Title/7. Seizure Management
Text/
Indication:  suspected seizure. Seizures increase cerebral metabolic rate and ICP.

• Diazepam 10 mg IV (0.2 mg/kg) or Midazolam 10 mg IM (0.2 mg/kg) initially (see Status Epilepticus for further management).



Title/8. Fever Management
Text/
Indication:  temperature > 37.7°C.  Fever should be avoided since it increases metabolic rate by 10% per degree Celsius and is a potent vasodilator.

• Paracetamol 1 g IV and/or physical cooling measures.

• Consider antibiotics in the setting of suspected infection.



Title/9. Hypertonic Saline?
Text/
Indication:  unconscious + fixed dilated pupil (i.e. impending brain hernation).  Osmotic agents exert their effect by extracting water from the neurons where the blood-brain-barrier is intact.  Blood hyperosmolarity must be maintained until the underlying cause has been addressed, otherwise the gradient for water transfer is reversed, resulting in rebound increase in intracranial pressure.

• Add 20 ml of NaCl concentrate 4 mmol/ml (i.e. 80 mmol) to a 250 ml bag of normal saline (NaCl 0.9%).  This yields a 270 ml solution containing 120 mmol of NaCl, i.e. a 2.94% NaCl solution.  Administer 275 ml IV of NaCl 3% over 5 minutes (2-4 ml/kg for children).



Title/10. Corticosteroids?
Text/
Indication:  known brain tumor or CNS-infection (but not traumatic brain injury, stroke)

• Betamethasone 4 mg/ml 4 ml IV



Title/11. Head CT
Text/
Indication:  all.

• Urgent non-contrast head CT
